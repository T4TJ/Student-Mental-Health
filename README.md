# Student-Mental-Health

The focus of this project is on the mental well-being of students within a specific school. The school has gathered data with the aim of identifying the gender that experiences the highest levels of depression, anxiety, and panic attacks, as well as the gender that is most commonly receiving specialized treatment for these conditions. Additionally, the project seeks to determine which gender is most academically gifted.

The following steps were undertaken in this project:

1. Essential Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and numpy were imported.

2. The CSV file was imported to Jupyter Lab using the read_csv function.

3. To ensure that the correct data was imported, the df.head() function was used to check for data.

4. Data cleaning involved checking data types, identifying null and duplicate values.

5. Once data cleaning was complete, charts corresponding to the questions asked were plotted. It's worth noting that Jupyter Notebook Lab was used as the environment for this project
